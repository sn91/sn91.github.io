I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Clausthal University of Technology, Germany. My Master's thesis focuses on **Traceability and Impact Analysis for DevOps-Based Airborne Software** at DLR Braunschweig.

I'm currently working as a Research Assistant (HiWi) at TU Clausthal, where I'm building a **RAG-based factual reasoning pipeline** to analyze and reduce hallucinations in mid-sized LLMs. This involves evaluating 8B-parameter models using custom benchmarks, embedding similarity metrics, and experimenting with knowledge editing techniques for trustworthy LLM behavior.

My professional experience spans **Software Engineering** and **DevOps**. At HolyPoly GmbH, I designed VM setups for Flet/Flutter development and managed deployments with Docker. At CARIAD SE (Volkswagen Group), I developed ETL pipelines for PowerBI dashboards and assisted in CI/CD pipeline design for Audi ADAS projects using Jenkins and containerized environments.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Indore Institute of Science and Technology, India (2014-2018).

**Technical Skills:**
- **Programming:** Python, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript (learning), React
- **DevOps & Tools:** CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Jenkins, Git, Bitbucket, Vagrant, Linux
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, PowerBI
- **Software Engineering:** UML, SysML, ASPICE, Software Validation, Agile/Scrum, TDD
