I’m a **Software Engineer** with a strong interest in building reliable, data-driven systems that solve real-world problems. With a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Clausthal University of Technology, and focus on backend development, full-stack applications, and high-quality software engineering.

Alongside my studies, I worked as a Research Assistant (HiWi) at TU Clausthal, where I build a **RAG-based factual reasoning pipeline** to evaluate and reduce hallucinations in mid-sized language models. My work includes benchmarking 8B-parameter LLMs, analyzing embedding-based retrieval quality, and experimenting with techniques for more trustworthy model behavior.

I work primarily with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React, and enjoy designing APIs, automating workflows, and transforming complex data into clear, traceable systems. Through industry roles at **Volkswagen Group (CARIAD)** and **HolyPoly GmbH**, as well as research projects with the **German Aerospace Center (DLR)**, I’ve gained hands-on experience with data pipelines, CI/CD environments, and production-ready web applications.

I’m driven by building software that is not only functional, but trustworthy—well-documented, testable, and designed for long-term impact. I enjoy learning new technologies, collaborating across disciplines, and working on systems that combine engineering quality with meaningful purpose.

**Technical Skills:**
- **Programming:** Python, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript (learning), React
- **DevOps & Tools:** CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Jenkins, Git, Bitbucket, Vagrant, Linux
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, PowerBI
- **Software Engineering:** UML, SysML, ASPICE, Software Validation, Agile/Scrum, TDD
